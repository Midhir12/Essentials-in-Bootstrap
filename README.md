# Essentials-in-Bootstrap
Hi I worked on these assignments during the 3 Days Free Essentials in Bootstrap, conducted by <b> LETSUPGRADE
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Saurabh Gupta. I got to
learn a lot during these 3 days and it was an amazing experience learning with LETSUPGRADE.

I enjoyed these 3 days, you can as well. Everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
